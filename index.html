                    Vulnerabilities reported to Naver Corporation will be disclosed to the public 45 days after
                    releasing fixes to our customers. Extenuating circumstances, such as active exploitation,
                    threats of an especially serious (or trivial) nature, or situations that require changes to an
                    established standard may result in earlier or later disclosure. Disclosures made by Naver
                    Corporation will include credit to the reporter unless otherwise requested by the reporter.
